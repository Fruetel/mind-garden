# Thomas Frütel

My name is Thomas Frütel. I was born in Essen, Germany on February 20, 1973. Nowadays I live in the city of Duisburg with my family.

I work as a software engineer for InVision AG in Düsseldorf, specializing in RESTFul HTTP APIs. My programming language of choice is [[Ruby]]. I have a history of building industrial strength websites in PHP, and I've written production code in Elixir, ES6 and Typescript. I know a bit of Python, but have only used it in academic settings and for a few toy projects.
