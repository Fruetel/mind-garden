# Digital Gardening

My idea of a Digital Gardening is a constantly evolving website that is used for cultivating digital content. Unlike a blog, there is no chronological order to content pieces, and articles (or notes) are cultivated over time.

It's a concept that currently has a lot of traction in my [[Social Media]] bubble.

Most pages in this site will be work in progress most of the time. That's part of the idea, and it is what sets a
Digital Garden apart from a blog, that usually consists of refined, finished articles. I have been a somewhat
active blogger for many years. Right now, I do not have a blog, but maybe some day the garden is cultivated
enough to provide raw material for a new blog.
