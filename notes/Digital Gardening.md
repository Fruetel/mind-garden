# Digital Gardening

My idea of a Digital Gardening is a constantly evolving website that is used for cultivating digital content. Unlike a blog, there is no chronological order to content pieces, and articles (or notes) are cultivated over time.

It's a concept that currently has a lot of traction in my social media bubble.
