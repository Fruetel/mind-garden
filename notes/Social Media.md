# Social Media

I can honestly say I was into social media before it became a thing. I even
ran a German social media platform called `Netzclan` back in 2004, but
unfortunately it never took off, so I didn't become the German Zuckerberg.

When Facebook became popular, I was a heavy user, but these days I primarily
turn to Twitter for communication and networking, and Instagram to occasionally
share a photo from my life. I follow around 1.500 people on Twitter and my
Newsfeed gives me valuable insights. The idea to build a digital garden was
at least partially influenced by people I follow.

I try to post several times a day on Twitter, and sharing ideas with my
followers is a great tool for reflection.
