# API Design

API design is the process of designing APIs so that the interface effectively exposes data and functionality for consumption by other applications. Key aspects to consider when designing an API are functional requirements, such as structure of resources end endpoints, as well as non-functional requirements, e.g. documentation or performance metrics.
