# My Digital Garden

Hi, I'm [[Thomas]]. This is my Digital Garden. It is an attempt to order my thoughts, ideas and fragments of knowledge in a public space. It was inspired by the fantastic Wiki of [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/).

The first incarnation of this site was launched 2019-11-19 with [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), and can still be found at [wiki.fruetel.net](https://wiki.fruetel.net). After learning more about the concept of [[Digital Gardening]] I decided to give it a try and evolve the Wiki towards becoming a Digital Garden. I'm now in the process of moving content from the old Wiki to this site.
